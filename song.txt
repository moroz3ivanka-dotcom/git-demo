I don’t need your love
I can see you staring
Carelessly
Turn your head to me
When the song comes on
When the song comes on
Cos I’m falling
Falling for the night
Oh I’m calling
Calling for you now .... X2
Feels like
I’m going in too deep
Cos tonight
I’ll give you what you need
Feels like
Nothing is what It seems
But tonight
I’ll give you what you need
I don’t need your love
I can see you staring
Carelessly
Turn your head to me
When the song comes on
When the song comes on
Cos I’m falling
Falling for the night
Oh I’m calling
Calling for you now
Cos I’m falling
Falling for the night
Oh I’m calling
Calling for you now
